<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm Prajwal Nayak, a 4th year student at IIT Bombay. With a strong foundation in electronics and signal processing from IIT Bombay and hands-on experience in web stacks, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to every project. I am extremely intersted in technology, startups and businesses. My hobbies include drawing, singing, reading, trekking, working out, meditating, and a lot much more. I am a social person. I consider myself to be an oen minded soul, who loves understanding people. I believe that health(includes physical, mental and social) and self should be the priority of one. I love helping people and would like to contribute to social causes. There is a lot of difficulty in this world and one small step of kindness could change lives.</p>
