    <u><i><h1>MY PORTFOLIO</h1></i></u>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m Prajwal Nayak, a 4th year student at IIT Bombay. With a strong foundation in electronics and signal processing from IIT Bombay and hands-on experience in web stacks, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to every project. I am extremely intersted in technology, startups and businesses. My hobbies include drawing, singing, reading, trekking, working out, meditating, and a lot much more. I am a social person. I consider myself to be an oen minded soul, who loves understanding people. I believe that health(includes physical, mental and social) and self should be the priority of one. I love helping people and would like to contribute to social causes. There is a lot of difficulty in this world and one small step of kindness could change lives.</p>

 <h3> Highlighted Projects </h3>
<p>
I have worked on a lot of projects. Some of them include IITB‑CPU‑Pipelined, modular lab projects using GNU Radio for communications, ranging from signal modulation to filter design. Demonstrated through Python-based workflows, Simulations and experiments in motor control, inverted pendulum stabilization, line-follower robotics, and active noise cancellation, Digital Circuits, Complex VHDL and Verilog designs implemented through Quartus, covering a range of combinational and sequential circuit assignments, Detailed device-level investigations—diodes, MOSFET, BJT behaviors—using NGSPICE and NanoHub for semiconductor analysis, biometrics (Fingerprint Classification) using wavelets, A Python + MocoV2/ResNet project for contactless fingerprint classification, featuring data augmentation, denoising pipelines, and training worflows, JPEG Image Compression Engine, Implemented grayscale image compression using JPEG-like methods, edge detection with Marr‑Hildreth, and JBIG encoding in Python/MATLAB, Exoskeleton Glove (Capstone Prototype), An exoskeleton glove built with Python and C# components, hinting at interest in human–computer interaction and robotics prototyping,
and many more. For more details on my projects, visit <a href="projects.html">MY PROJECTS page.</a> </p>
