<h3>My Education</h3>
<p>I had my school education in Parivarthan Gurukul Heritage, Hubballi, Karnakata, India. I studied high school (class 11 and 12) in BASE PU College. I gave multiple examinations and secured pretty good ranks in them. I ended up in IIT Bombay in Environmental science and Engineering. After my first yera, i had enough CGPA to chnage my branch to Electrical Engineering, and therefore chnaged my major degree to ELectrical Engineering Dual Degree. Right now i am in my 4th year of pursuing my degree. For more details, click on this <a href="education.html">link</a>. </p>

 <h3> Highlighted Projects </h3>
<p>
I have worked on a lot of projects. Some of them include IITB‑CPU‑Pipelined, modular lab projects using GNU Radio for communications, ranging from signal modulation to filter design. Demonstrated through Python-based workflows, Simulations and experiments in motor control, inverted pendulum stabilization, line-follower robotics, and active noise cancellation, Digital Circuits, Complex VHDL and Verilog designs implemented through Quartus, covering a range of combinational and sequential circuit assignments, Detailed device-level investigations—diodes, MOSFET, BJT behaviors—using NGSPICE and NanoHub for semiconductor analysis, biometrics (Fingerprint Classification) using wavelets, A Python + MocoV2/ResNet project for contactless fingerprint classification, featuring data augmentation, denoising pipelines, and training worflows, JPEG Image Compression Engine, Implemented grayscale image compression using JPEG-like methods, edge detection with Marr‑Hildreth, and JBIG encoding in Python/MATLAB, Exoskeleton Glove (Capstone Prototype), An exoskeleton glove built with Python and C# components, hinting at interest in human–computer interaction and robotics prototyping,
and many more. For more details on my projects, visit <a href="projects.html">MY PROJECTS page.</a> </p>
